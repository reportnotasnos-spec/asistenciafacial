I have created a new migration to add a `role` column to your `users` table.

**To apply this change to your database, please run the migration script again:**

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2.  **Navigate to your project directory:** (`F:\appdev\www\asistenciafacial`).
3.  **Run the command:**
    ```bash
    php migrate.php
    ```

The script will detect the new migration file and add the `role` column to your `users` table with a default value of `'student'`.

Let me know once you have run this migration.
